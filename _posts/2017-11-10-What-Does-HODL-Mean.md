title: What Does "HODL" Mean?
---

Today, I felt it appropriate to give you some backstory about the term "HODL".

If you're reading this, you've obviously seen the word by now. You may have even thought that I was misspelling the world "hold." HODL is technically a mispeling of "hold," but it's very much intentional.

So where does this word come from?

To understand HODL, first you need to understand what a _meme_ is.

Here's [Urban Dictionary's definition of _meme_](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meme):

> An image, video, or set of text that becomes popular and spreads rapidly via the internet. Some examples of memes are Doge, Pepe, and the YouTuber called Danisnotonfire.

The Internet gets a hold of something — usually something funny — and it goes viral. If you've seen a funny picture with giant white letters on it, then you've seen a meme. It doesn't necessarily have to be a picture like that, but that's a common example.

This is what happened with the world HODL.

Back in 2013, someone was really drunk and [posted on the popular Bitcoin talk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.msg4022997#msg4022997) about how they were HODLing their Bitcoin even though the price was going down.

The term has since become acronym for "Hold On for Dear Life" — which is a very accurate term for the feeling you have when you're holding a bunch of a cryptocurrency and the price starts to crash. But you're convinced it's going to go up in the future, and so you Hold On for Dear Life — you HODL.

This is very common in the crypto world because it's a very volatile market — prices jump up and down all the time. But if you can choose currencies that are overall trending upward, you'll see good returns on your investments.
