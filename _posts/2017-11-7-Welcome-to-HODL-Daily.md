Cryptocurrency, blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, tokens, Litecoin, Altcoins, coins — what is all this anyway?

## What is all this?

If you've been hearing these words more and more lately, you're not alone. And if you've been scratching your head as you hear them, you're also not alone. 

The world of blockchain and cryptocurrency (which are two separate things, by the way) is a fast moving one. Just this week, CoinBase, a popular U.S. based crypto exchange, [added 100,000 users in **_one day_**](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/03/coinbase-adds-100000-users-after-cme-announces-bitcoin-futures-plans.html), bringing their total userbase to 11.9 million.

All of this is moving extremely fast, but overall it's still in the very early stages — meaning there's still time to learn about what all this is and how you can get in on it.

I've known _generally_ about cryptocurrency for years, but it wasn't until a few months ago that I really started diving in and trying to understand what it is, as well as what blockchain is, and how these new technologies will affect our world.

I believe the best way to learn is to do it, then teach it. So I've started HODL (rhymes with _"waddle"_) daily to share everything I'm learning about this fascinating world of crypto. And don't worry if you're not technical — by trade I've been a software consultant for the past 5 years, and [I specialize in working with non-technical people](https://jchiatt.com). If you feel lost or intimidated by tech but want to understand what these new technologies are, then you're in the right place. 

I'll do my best to make everything I write easy to understand even if you aren't tech-savvy. I'm sure I'll miss the mark at times though, so please always feel free to leave comments or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/hodldaily) with your questions!

## What I'll be sharing here
This is by no means an exhaustive list, as I'm not even sure what all I will learn as I keep learning, but in general, stick around long enough and you'll learn:

1. What is blockchain?
2. What is cryptocurrency?
3. How to buy Bitcoin
4. How to buy Ethereum
5. How to buy Litecoin
6. How to buy Altcoins
7. How to secure your cryptocurrency
8. Altcoins that I find really interesting
9. How to keep up with crypto news yourself
10. How to participate in an ICO

I'm also planning to keep a "pretend" portfolio where I take an imaginary amount of money and trade it on a weekly basis. I think this will be a great way for both you and me to learn how to trade cryptocurrency more effectively.

I'm planning to write pretty much every week day. I'll always tweet each article, so feel free to [follow HODL Daily on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hodldaily) to stay up-to-date! If you prefer audio or video, I'm also setting up a podcast (link coming soon) as well as [a YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz-R1TDwOkjJyFjvPuXT2xA). The same content will be posted to all three mediums each day, so take your pick!
