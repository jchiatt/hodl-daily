title: What is Cryptocurrency?
---

Yesterday, I talked a bit about what currency is. Today, we'll focus in on _crypto_currency.

I'm fairly new to this space, and although I'm a software developer by trade, I still am by no means an expert on these things so if I say something wrong please let me know! I'll be happy to correct myself and give you credit!

Yesterday, I ended by asking you what you think the benefits are of a cryptocurrency as opposed to a typical paper and coin currency.

Just by knowing that cryptocurrency is _purely digital_ (as in, it's not sitting in your wallet in your pocket), this should immediately set off some thoughts about how cryptocurrency could be the next iteration of currency.

What I was getting at is this: yesterday, we evolved from having apples as an orchard owner and taking them around and trying to trade them for jeans or whatever. Now, we've evolved into using paper or metal coins which are much more transportable and they also don't rot after a short amount of time like apples do. As a civilization, that was our next iteration of currency.

Cryptocurrency, on the other hand, is purely digital — there's nothing physical that you hold in your hand. That means you have even less to carry around with you. All you need to have a "wallet" (where your cryptocurrency is stored) is two pieces of information that you can generate — a public address and a private key. Your public address is a really long string of text — random letters and numbers — that you can give someone who needs to send you money. This is similar to giving your account number and routing number to someone. That's how you receive money.

To actually create transactions from that wallet, you have your private key. This is also a very long series of letters and numbers, and _it's the only way_ to gain access to your wallet and send money from it — whether you want to send your Bitcoin to someone, or convert it into another cryptocurrency like Ethereum, or convert it into USD.

If you lose your private key, you have no way to access your funds. They are lost forever unless you suddenly recover your private key somehow. There are many tragic stories where people have lost their private keys to wallets they had years ago — wallets that still have dozens or even hundreds of Bitcoin in them — wallets that are now worth tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars — but they can't access them because they lost their private key (or their hard drive, which is the only place they stored their private key, crashed). If you lose your private key, you can't access your money, nor can anyone else. It does not get redistributed into the network — it's just lost forever unless you somehow find your private key again. It exists, but it can't be accessed or transferred.

You don't have to fully understand that at this time.

Going back to the common traits of a cryptocurrency:

1. They're purely digital
  * You have a public address and a private key. These are not the currency, they are just the wallet and the key to access that wallet.
  * The currency is essentially one's and zero's that the network agrees is currency. We'll dive deeper into this later.
  * Cryptocurrency is not physical at all. There have been scams on sites like eBay where people are selling physical coins and calling them Bitcoin. That is _not_ cryptocurrency — that's a scam.

2. They're decentralized
  * This means there is no central bank, governing authority, regulartory body, etc. that we have to trust to keep track of our money and ensure their ledger stays accurate, our money stays safe, and our identities remain safe.
    * These organizations fail at this all the time — Equifax just had 143 million people's personal data stolen in a security breach.
